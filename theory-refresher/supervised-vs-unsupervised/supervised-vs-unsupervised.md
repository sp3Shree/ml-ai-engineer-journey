# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

## 🔍 What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning uses **labeled data**, meaning the model is trained with both input and output (target) values.

**Examples**:
- Predicting house prices (regression)
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam (classification)

## 🔍 What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning works with **unlabeled data**, and the goal is to discover hidden patterns.

**Examples**:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
